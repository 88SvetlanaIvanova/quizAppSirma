🧩 How It Works
🧠 1. Quiz Discovery

At startup or when you visit /quizzes,
the app scans the classpath folder:

src/main/resources/quizzes/


and detects all files ending with .json or .csv.

Each detected file becomes a “quiz topic” in the quiz list.

Example:
computer_science.csv → displayed as “Computer science”

🧮 2. Quiz Loading

Depending on the file extension, the appropriate loader is used:

Loader	File Type	Class
JsonQuizLoader	.json	Parses using Jackson
CsvQuizLoader	.csv	Parses using Apache Commons CSV

Both loaders produce a List<Question>.

🧑‍🏫 3. Quiz Session

When you start a quiz (/quiz/{topic}/0):

The QuizSession object is created or reset.

The app tracks your:

current quiz topic

questions list

answers list

start time and duration (for timer)

All of this is kept in your HTTP session (no DB required).

🧭 4. Navigation

Each question page shows:

The current question text and 4 options.

“Previous” and “Next” buttons to navigate.

“Submit” button on the last question.

Remaining time (countdown).

🕒 5. Timer

The timer is handled in the frontend (JavaScript) and backed by session attributes:

quizStartTime

quizDurationMillis

If time runs out:

The JS script automatically submits the form.

The controller detects no action and redirects to /submit?timeout=true.

The quiz is graded automatically.

🧾 6. Results

The results page shows:

Total score and percentage.

A green progress bar indicating performance.

Each question, with:

✅ Green background for correct answer.

❌ Red background for user’s wrong answer.

“Retake Quiz” and “Back to Quizzes” buttons.

A warning alert if the quiz timed out.

Quiz File Formats

To add quiz file .json or .csv save the file in src\main\resources\quizzes
JSON Format Example

[
  {
    "text": "What does CPU stand for?",
    "options": ["Central Process Unit", "Central Processing Unit", "Computer Personal Unit", "Central Peripheral Unit"],
    "correctIndex": 1
  },
  {
    "text": "Which data structure uses FIFO?",
    "options": ["Stack", "Queue", "Tree", "Graph"],
    "correctIndex": 1
  }
]

CSV Format Example

question,option1,option2,option3,option4,correctIndex
What does CPU stand for?,Central Process Unit,Central Processing Unit,Computer Personal Unit,Central Peripheral Unit,1
Which data structure uses FIFO?,Stack,Queue,Tree,Graph,1


The first line must be the header:

question,option1,option2,option3,option4,correctIndex


Each subsequent line defines one question.

correctIndex is zero-based (e.g., 0 = first option).
